1. Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)
   - This notebook is structured very well. It was easy to understand and I was able to follow all of the steps. The reflections were well thought out and the model worked for the data. 

2. Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)
   - The chosen features: Chest Pain Type, Max Heart Rate, and Exercise Induced Angina all work for the data and for the real world. These are features that make sense based on how heart disease is preemptively diagnosed. There is no need to create any new features as this dataset has many features however, you could combine age and sex to create groups of people that may indicate risk factors for heart disease. Unsure if this is necessary but could be interesting. 
   - I would suggest experimenting with creating new features, just to see what data may be correlated. 

3. Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)
   - Yes, the results are explained well. You can see that the Logistic Regression model performed very well, achieving a high Accuracy (89%). The Decision Tree model did not perform as well as the Logistic Regression as its Accuracy was 74%. Decision Tree models are prone to overfitting when faced with a smaller dataset like this one. The relationship between the features and the target is closer to linear. 
   - If I had done this dataset and had more time, I may have tried out all of the different models to see if there were two that had the best accuracy. 

4. Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)
   - Yes, the reflections are not only well thought out, they are also organized to be easily readable. It is professional yet not too technical. If I wanted to repeat this process, I could do so easily just by reading this notebook.
