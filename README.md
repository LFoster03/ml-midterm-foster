### Launch Notebook: classification_foster

### Load and Inspect Data
- Loaded dataset into pandas DataFrames for features (X) and target (y).
- Displayed the first 10 rows of the dataset and verified feature names and target variable.
- Check for missing values and duplicates.
- ***Findings*** All columns have no missing values except stalk-root, which has 2,480 missing entries (~30% of rows). There are no duplicate rows.
- Fill missing 'stalk-root' values with 'unknown'.
- ***Summary Statistics*** Most features are categorical with a small number of unique values. Target variable class is balanced between edible and poisonous mushrooms.

### Data Exploration and Preparation

#### Patterns and Anomalies Observed
- Most features in the Mushroom dataset are categorical, with a small set of unique values per feature.  
- The target variable (poisonous) is roughly balanced, which is ideal for classification tasks.  
- Some categories are rare (e.g., certain odor or cap-color values), which could be highly predictive.  
- The stalk-root column had 30% missing values, which needed attention to avoid biasing the model.

#### Features That Stand Out
- odor: Certain odors strongly correlate with poisonous mushrooms and are likely key predictors.  
- cap_look : A new feature created by combining cap-shape and cap-color, capturing patterns not evident from individual features.  
- stalk-root : After imputing missing values, this feature adds predictive information.

#### Prep Steps
1. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Imputed missing values in stalk-root with "unknown" to preserve all rows.  
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created cap_look by combining cap-shape and cap-color to summarize the mushroom’s overall appearance.  
3. **Encoding Categorical Variables**
   - Applied one-hot encoding using pd.get_dummies() to convert categorical features into numeric columns.  
4. **Scaling / Normalization (Optional)**
   - Not necessary for tree-based models (Decision Tree, Random Forest). Required only for models sensitive to feature scale, such as Logistic Regression or MLP.

#### Feature Selection and Modification
- Selected key features likely to contribute to predictive power: cap_look, odor, stalk-root.  
- One-hot encoding expanded categorical features into binary columns for better interpretability and modeling.  
- Combined features like cap_look were created to capture interactions and patterns that improve model performance.

#### Reflection
> During data exploration, I identified key predictive features (odor and cap_look) and addressed missing values in stalk-root by imputing "unknown".  
> One-hot encoding transformed categorical variables into numeric form suitable for modeling. Creating combined features, like cap_look, allowed the model to detect patterns that individual features alone might not capture.

### Feature Selection and Justification
- Features: cap_look, odor, stalk-root

- Target: poisonous (encoded as 0/1)

- Rationale: These features are meaningful, interpretable, and likely to improve model performance.

- Preprocessing: Combined features, imputed missing values, and one-hot encoding applied.

* I selected cap_look, odor, and stalk-root as input features because they are directly related to mushroom characteristics that indicate edibility or toxicity.

- I created a heatmap to discern a relationship between cap_look and odor to see if there were any crossovers. All mushrooms with odor n of all cap looks were *not* poisonous.

- Selected features: 'cap_look', 'odor', 'stalk-root' for predictive power.
- 'odor' is highly indicative of poisonous mushrooms.
- 'cap_look' combines cap shape and color to capture visual patterns.
- 'stalk-root' provides structural information and missing values were imputed as 'unknown'.
- One-hot encoding converts categorical data into numeric form suitable for modeling.
- These features are expected to improve prediction accuracy and model interpretability.

In this section, we train a **Decision Tree classifier** to predict whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible.

### 4.1 Split the Data
- The dataset was split into **training (70%)** and **test (30%)** sets using `train_test_split`.  
- The split was **stratified** by the target variable `poisonous` to maintain class balance between edible and poisonous mushrooms.  

### 4.2 Train the Model
- A **Decision Tree classifier** was trained using Scikit-Learn's `fit()` method on the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`).  
- Input features used for training:  
  - `cap_look` (combined cap shape + color)  
  - `odor`  
  - `stalk-root`  

### 4.3 Evaluate Performance
- The model was evaluated using common **classification metrics**:
  - **Accuracy** – proportion of correctly classified mushrooms.  
  - **Precision** – proportion of predicted poisonous mushrooms that are truly poisonous.  
  - **Recall** – proportion of actual poisonous mushrooms that were correctly identified.  
  - **F1-score** – harmonic mean of precision and recall.  
- Additionally, we generated a **confusion matrix** and a **full classification report** to inspect detailed performance.

### 4.4 Key Results
- The Decision Tree model achieved **high accuracy** due to the strong predictive power of features like `odor` and `cap_look`.  
- The confusion matrix highlights how well the model distinguishes between edible and poisonous mushrooms.  
- Overall, the model demonstrates the effectiveness of our feature selection and preprocessing steps.

### 4.5 Next Steps
- Compare the Decision Tree with alternative classifiers such as **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, or **SVC**.  
- Tune hyperparameters (e.g., tree depth, minimum samples per leaf) to further improve model performance.  
- Visualize the confusion matrix as a heatmap for easier interpretation of misclassifications.

### Reflection: 
This model performed very well. The model performance metrics are all close to 99%.
- Accuracy: 0.9979 → about 99.8% of mushrooms were correctly classified. This is very high and indicates your model is correctly predicting most samples.
- Precision: 0.9991 → of all mushrooms predicted as poisonous, 99.9% were actually poisonous. High precision means few false positives (few edible mushrooms were wrongly labeled as poisonous).
- Recall: 0.9966 → of all actual poisonous mushrooms, 99.66% were correctly identified. High recall means few false negatives (few poisonous mushrooms were missed).
- F1-score: 0.9979 → combines precision and recall. Close to 1 → your model balances precision and recall extremely well.
- Confusion matrix shows:
  - TP (1262): edible mushrooms correctly classified
  - FP (1): edible mushrooms incorrectly classified as poisonous
  - FN (4): poisonous mushrooms incorrectly classified as edible
  - TN (1171): poisonous mushrooms correctly classified
- Only 5 misclassifications out of 2438 test samples.


### Section 5. Improve the Model or Try Alternates (Implement a Second Option)

## 🔄 Section 5: Improve the Model / Try Alternative Classifiers

To evaluate whether a different modeling approach could improve performance, we trained a **Random Forest classifier** as an alternative to the Decision Tree.

### 5.1 Train an Alternative Model
- **Random Forest** was trained using 100 estimators (`n_estimators=100`) with default hyperparameters.  
- Same input features were used as in the Decision Tree:
  - `cap_look` (cap shape + color)  
  - `odor`  
  - `stalk-root`  

### 5.2 Compare Performance
| Metric      | Decision Tree | Random Forest |
|------------|---------------|---------------|
| Accuracy   | 0.9979        | 0.9984        |
| Precision  | 0.9991        | 0.9992        |
| Recall     | 0.9966        | 0.9974        |
| F1-score   | 0.9979        | 0.9983        |

- **Confusion Matrices** show very few misclassifications in both models, indicating that the dataset is highly predictable with these features.  
- Random Forest slightly improved metrics over the Decision Tree, demonstrating the benefit of **ensemble methods** for stability and minor performance gains.

### 5.3 Insights
- Both models perform exceptionally well due to the highly predictive nature of features like `odor` and `cap_look`.  
- Random Forest offers slightly better recall, reducing the chance of missing poisonous mushrooms.  
- The comparison supports that **ensemble methods** can provide small but meaningful improvements on top of simple tree-based models.  

### 5.4 Next Steps
- Hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest could further improve performance.  
- Experiment with other classifiers like **Logistic Regression** or **SVC** for comparison.  
- Visualize feature importance from the Random Forest to see which features are driving predictions.

## 📝 Section 6: Final Thoughts & Insights

### 6.1 Summary of Findings
- The classification models were able to predict whether a mushroom is **poisonous or edible** with extremely high accuracy (>99%).  
- Key features driving predictions:
  - **Odor** – most predictive of poisonous mushrooms  
  - **Cap_look** – combination of cap shape and color  
  - **Stalk-root** – structural characteristic  
- Both **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** performed almost perfectly due to the strong predictive features.  

### 6.2 Challenges Faced
- Handling the **missing values** in `stalk-root` required careful preprocessing; we imputed missing values as `"unknown"`.  
- Encoding categorical features into a numerical format with **one-hot encoding** increased the number of features, which could become cumbersome for larger datasets.  
- Ensuring proper **stratified splits** to maintain class balance required attention.  

### 6.3 Next Steps
- Experiment with **hyperparameter tuning** for Random Forest to optimize tree depth, number of estimators, and minimum samples per leaf.  
- Try **additional classifiers** (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines) to compare robustness.  
- Investigate **feature importance** to understand which mushroom characteristics are most critical for classification.  
- Visualize **decision boundaries** or feature interactions to improve interpretability.
